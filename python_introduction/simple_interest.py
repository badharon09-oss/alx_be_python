# Step 1: Define variables
principal = 1000   # initial investment
rate = 0.05        # annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3           # investment period in years

# Step 2: Calculate simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Step 3: Print the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
